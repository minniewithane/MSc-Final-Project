## Idea Proposal
### 1. AI Life Coach
**Image-to-text area**:
- Project idea: Building an AI life coach that converts user-generated vision boards into actionable life and career advice.
- What is it about: This project involves developing an AI system that takes an image of a user's vision board and translates it into keywords. Based on these keywords, the AI provides personalized life and career advice, focusing on goal setting, milestones, and strategies for a well-lived, joyful life, as inspired by the book [Designing Your Life](https://www.amazon.ae/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321)
- Key Features:
    - Image recognition and keyword extraction from vision boards.
    - Natural language processing (NLP) to interpret extracted keywords.
    - Interface for users to upload vision boards and receive feedback.
    - Database of life coaching logic and resources.
- Expected Difficulties:
    - How to implement image recognition and keyword extraction from diverse and complex vision board images?
    - How to link personalization of the advice provided with extracted keywords?
    - How to add desinated logic or strategy to adjust the answer of the suggestion?
  

### 2.Meal Plan Recommendation for People with Diabetes

**Friendly Bot** :

- Project Idea: A health chatbot as a personal trainer for managing the health of people with diabetes by tracking food intake, blood glucose levels, and other health metrics to provide meal plan recommendations.
- What is it about: User can record food intake, blood glucose levels, and chatbot will analyze and recommend personalized meal plans. Rather than mainstreamed health/fitness app that focus more on food calories, It will emphasize carbohydrate intake and glycemic index. A more ideal outcome is that the bot can be trained learn the impact of specific foods on blood glucose levels for specific user (as each user have very difference blood sugar response on each food)
- Key Features:
    - record and track data of food intake, blood glucose levels or other health metrics.
    - personalized meal plan recommendations based on carbohydrate intake and glycemic index.
    - Real-time analysis of blood glucose changes and assessment of food impacts. (this seems impossible as it needs connected to continuous blood glucose monitoring devices)
    - Interactive interface for users to input data and receive recommendations.
- Expected Difficulties:
    - No knowledge on developing precise algorithms to assess the impact of various foods on blood glucose levels, nor finding existing algorithms to do so.
    - How to get the data of individual responses to food.
    - how to Integrate continuous glucose monitoring data with real-time recommendations.
